Ten-Second Install Instructions:

1) ZIP up the files you find in this repository (or use github to download the repo as a ZIP file).
2) Using QGIS 3.12 or newer, navigate to the Plugins menu and choose Manage and Install Plugins.
3) Click "Install from ZIP" on the lefthand side.
4) Browse to the ZIP file you created.
5) Use the two new toolbar items to upload and download maps from Scribble Maps.

In the future, the plugin will likely also be published to the QGIS plugin repository, so it may be found directly under the listing in "Manage and Install Plugins" after that time.
